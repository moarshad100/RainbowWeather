# RainbowWeather

For Module 6 I have been given a task to create a weather Application that would display current weather and 4 days of forecast.

![An example of the Application](./assets/weather.png)

```
API
I have used two API's in my application 
* GeoAPI
    To get the user input and to calculate the lat and lon
* 5 day weather forecast API
    After getting the lat and lon. It can be applied to this API to get the datas required for our application
```
